# Image Processing using Tensorflow

This project involves building a multi-class image classification model using a pre-trained VGG16 neural network. The model is fine-tuned to classify images into multiple categories by adding custom dense layers on top of the VGG16 base. The dataset is augmented and normalized using ImageDataGenerator, and the model is trained and evaluated using training and validation datasets. After training, the model's accuracy is assessed, and a function is provided to predict the class of new images by processing and using the trained model for classification. This approach leverages transfer learning to efficiently handle image recognition tasks.
